The Alert Probe Controller is designed to periodically perform health checks by calling a specific URL. Its purpose is to monitor the health of a service and send notifications in case of any issues. The controller does not make any modifications to the service itself.

## Description
### Functionality
The Alert Probe Controller performs the following tasks:
1. Periodically sends HTTP GET requests to a specified URL.
2. Checks the response status code and determines the health of the service.
3. Sends notifications if the health check fails.
4. Does not modify or interfere with the service in any way.

### Usage
Once the Alert Probe Controller is installed, it will automatically start monitoring the services based on the AlertProbe resources created in the cluster. To use the controller, follow these steps:
1. Create an AlertProbe resource with the desired URL and check period.
2. The controller will start sending health check requests to the specified URL at the configured intervals.
3. If the health check fails (non-200 response status code), the controller will send a notification.

Note: The controller does not perform any remedial actions on the service itself. It is responsible only for health monitoring and notifications.

-------------------------

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/github:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/github:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
